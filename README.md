# üè• HealthChain - Secure Health Record Tracker on Blockchain

## üß† Project Description
**HealthChain** is a simple decentralized health record management system built using **Solidity**.  
It allows patients to securely store, update, and share their medical records on the **Ethereum blockchain**, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability.  

This project is beginner-friendly and serves as a great starting point for learning how to handle **access control**, **data privacy**, and **smart contract design** in Solidity.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What It Does
- Patients can **create** and **update** their personal health records.  
- Doctors can be **authorized** by the system owner to view or modify patient records.  
- Only the **patient** or an **authorized doctor** can access specific records.  
- Every record change is logged and traceable on the blockchain.

## ‚ú® Features
‚úÖ **Secure Data Access** ‚Äî Only verified doctors and the patient can access or update records.  
‚úÖ **Transparent Authorization** ‚Äî Contract owner (admin) controls doctor permissions.  
‚úÖ **Immutable Records** ‚Äî All data stored on-chain is tamper-proof.  
‚úÖ **Beginner-Friendly Solidity** ‚Äî Clean, well-commented code for easy learning.  
‚úÖ **Event Logging** ‚Äî Emits events for record creation, updates, and doctor authorization.
