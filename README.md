# 🏥 HealthChain - Secure Health Record Tracker on Blockchain

## 🧠 Project Description
**HealthChain** is a simple decentralized health record management system built using **Solidity**.  
It allows patients to securely store, update, and share their medical records on the **Ethereum blockchain**, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability.  

This project is beginner-friendly and serves as a great starting point for learning how to handle **access control**, **data privacy**, and **smart contract design** in Solidity.

## ⚙️ What It Does
- Patients can **create** and **update** their personal health records.  
- Doctors can be **authorized** by the system owner to view or modify patient records.  
- Only the **patient** or an **authorized doctor** can access specific records.  
- Every record change is logged and traceable on the blockchain.
